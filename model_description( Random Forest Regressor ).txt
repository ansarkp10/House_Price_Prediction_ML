Random Forest Regressor (Regression Model) + Flask:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🌳 What is Random Forest Regressor?

Random Forest Regressor is a machine learning algorithm used for predicting continuous values, such as:

House Prices
Stock Prices
Temperature
Medical measurements

It works by combining many decision trees to make a stronger prediction.


⭐ WHY is it called “Random Forest”?

Breakdown:

🌲 Trees = Decision Trees

A Decision Tree predicts a value using simple rules.

Example:

	If OverallQual > 6 → Higher price  
	Else if Neighborhood = NridgHt → Higher price  
	Else → Lower price

🌳 Forest = A group of many trees

Random Forest creates 100+ trees, not just one.

🎲 “Random” because:

Each tree gets random subset of data

Each tree gets random subset of features

This randomness makes trees different from each other and stops overfitting.


⭐ How Random Forest Regressor Works:

1️⃣ Take your dataset
2️⃣ Create MANY trees (e.g., 100 trees)
3️⃣ Each tree predicts a price
4️⃣ Final prediction = average of all tree predictions

This averaging reduces error and creates a powerful, stable model.





⭐ How things really work
1. Training script (data_prep_and_train.py)

This script uses train.csv to:
train your ML model
build preprocessing steps
save everything into model.pkl
After training ONE TIME → you don’t need train.csv anymore.

2. Website (Flask app)

load model.pkl
load preprocess.pkl
take user input
feed into model
output prediction

No training happens here.

⭐ Therefore:
✔ WEBSITE DOES NOT NEED TRAINING DATA
✔ WEBSITE ONLY NEEDS TRAINED MODEL FILES

This is exactly how every ML website works in real life.

✔ Example:

You train a model on your laptop → save model.pkl
You upload model.pkl to server → website makes predictions → no training data required.
